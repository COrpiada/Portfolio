	<div class="textOverImage" style="background-image:url('image/1.jpg') "data-title="Tenderloin Recipe" data-text="A beef tenderloin, known as an eye fillet in Australasia, filet in France, Filet Mignon in Brazil, and fillet in the United Kingdom and South Africa, is cut from the loin of beef. As with all quadrupeds, the tenderloin refers to the psoas major muscle ventral to the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, near the kidneys. The tenderloin is an oblong shape spanning two primal cuts: the short loin (called the sirloin in Commonwealth countries) and the sirloin (called the rump in Commonwealth countries). The tenderloin sits beneath the ribs, next to the backbone. It has two ends: the butt and the tail. The smaller, pointed end—the tail—starts a little past the ribs, growing in thickness until it ends in the sirloin primal cut, which is closer to the butt of the cow. This muscle does very little work, so it is the tenderest part of the beef.">

<a href="turkey.html">
	<div class="textOverImage" style="background-image:url('image/2.jpg')" data-title="Stuffed Turkey Recipe" data-text="Stuffing, filling, or dressing is an edible mixture, normally consisting primarily of small cut-up pieces of bread or a similar starch and served as a side dish or used to fill a cavity in another food item while cooking. Many foods may be stuffed, including eggs, poultry, seafood, mammals, and vegetables, but chickens and turkey are the most common. Stuffing serves the dual purpose of helping to keep the meat moist while also adding to the mix of flavours of both the stuffing and the thing it is stuffed in.

	Poultry stuffing often consists of dried breadcrumbs, onion, celery, salt, pepper, and other spices and herbs, a common herb being sage. Giblets are often used.[1] Additions in the United Kingdom include dried fruits and nuts (such as apricots and flaked almonds), and chestnuts.">

<a href="egg.html">
	<div class="textOverImage" style="background-image:url('image/3.jpg')" data-title="Egg Blossom Recipe" data-text="Also known as the cuticle, bloom is the natural coating or covering on the eggshell that seals the eggshell pores. The bloom helps to prevent bacteria from getting inside the shell and reduces moisture loss from the egg. In nature, the bloom dries and flakes off. Before they are sent to market, eggs are washed and sanitized, removing the bloom. About 10% of egg packers give eggs a light coating of edible mineral oil to restore the bloom.">
