	   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCristine Joy A. Orpiada is a student of Central Luzon State University, currently taking a bachelor degree in Information Technology. She has an interest towards digital arts and animation. Because of that interest, she tried to make some digital arts, particularly, a comic. She also tried making animations. It's not descent as it is only composed of short clips and random moving things, specifically, a gif—which is a picture composed of multiple pictures that is when compliled, it gives you an illusion of a moving picture. 
	    
	    <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspShe has also interest in writing. She is a grammar nazi, but despite of that, she is not that good at grammar. She already wrote many short stories—and it is not about love. She tried writing novels, but it just ended up to be a draft because she never finished writing it. But there is something that she is proud of despite of that, she finsihed writing a novella or novelette—a type of story that is longer than short story and shorter than a novel.
